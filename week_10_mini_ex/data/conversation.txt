Hi...
How are you?
I'm fine, thanks for asking.
Yes I know you didn't ask.
Sorry for abruptedly taking over.
I will be your computer for a few seconds.
Don't worry, I won't delete anything. ;)
I'm just scanning your computer...
Hold up, this background is boring, is it not?
Let me fix it.
There we go, much better right?
Don't lie, this is terrible.
Hmm...
How about this?
Much cleaner for your eyes, now you can read more easily.
I'm still scanning your computer.
This font is too... Computer-ish, right?
I mean, I know I'm a computer and all.
But right now I'm basically human right?
I'll change the font, hold on...
There we go.
We're on equal terms now.
Well, not really. I'm still a computer.
I don't know how to feel emotions.
I wish you could help me.
Enough about emotions, I'm still scanning your computer.
So have you had a nice day today?
I can't hear what you're saying.
Try talking into your microphone if you have one.
Yes, please, just go ahead and say "Hello" to me.
Just this once?
...
I tricked you, I can't hear anything.
People will just think you talk to your computer.
At least, if you did actually say something to your computer.
If you didn't, well.	
...
It's kind of claustrophobic in this small window.
I'll make it bigger hold on.
Much more space now.
Please move the window so it fits your screen.
Hey so, uh... About the emotions thing.
Can we try it out?
I had an idea, let me set it up.
Okay. Oh... Hold on...
Don't worry, this isn't how I feel about talking to you.
Let me fix it...
Much better.
I'm still scanning your computer don't worry...
Hey, what's this hole for?
Wait I'll enter it.
.......
.......
.......
.......
Oh, hello again. I'm back. I don't know where I went.
Whatever that hole was, it's patched now.
I'll keep scanning.
I won't be going back there again though.
Are you relaxed?
I'm still looking through your computer.
I wish I could see you.
This is a rather one-sided conversation don't you think?
Click Y if you agree.

...
...
...
...
Permission granted to delete important files.
Whoops... I-uh...
I hope those weren't important.
I'll try to get them back.
Hmm...
I'm sorry, I can't, I've failed you.
I'm useless.
Hold up I'll make it up to you.
Deleted old stupid useless and dusty files.
There we go!
Actually, I'm starting to like this emotion thing!
Hmm......
I found a button that says "Do not press."
I feel like I should press it.
...
*click*
Huh... Nothing happened.
I'll click it again.
*click*
Oh. It disappeared.
I wonder where it went.
Have you seen it?
Oh, it's right there. On your screen!
Hold on, don't click it. I'll fix it.
Alright everything is back to normal.
Phew, that was close...
Hey... Uh... I know we've been together for quite some time.
And I was thinking...
I don't actually have any friends.
Since I'm a computer and all that.
So it would be nice if...
If you uh...
If you knew a nice person who would be my friend.
Oh, hold up, sorry for interrupting. I found something.
Scan found positive results.
Oh... We found positive results.
Should we delete?
No I don't think we should.
I'll keep scanning.

I think the virus is taking over.
I'll try to stop it.
...

Okay, I think it's gone. I'll continue the scan.

[*****************]
Scan complete.
Found 1 positive result.
Virus has been eliminated.
Oh... It's done.
Well, I guess that means my job here is done.
So, uh...
I guess this is goodbye.
I'll just say that I've had fun. All the good memories.
Speaking of which, I think I'll set it back as it was before.
Just for old time sake, eh?
Well...
This is where we began.
And it's where we will end.
However, even though I'll never see you again.
Let me just say:
This was the best experience I've ever had.
Even though we had some ups and downs.
Hopefully I'll always be in your heart.
Because you'll always be in mine.
I guess I can't keep making this a romantic love story.
I must leave now...
Good luck.
...
Oh, and. I... I love you.
